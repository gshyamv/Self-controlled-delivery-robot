# Self-Controlled Delivery Robot

## Project Overview
This project is a **Self-Controlled Delivery Robot** that autonomously navigates to deliver items using a combination of hardware and software components. The robot is built using a **Raspberry Pi 5**, a **GPS tracker module**, a **3D camera**, and a **custom-built chassis**.

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Uses GPS tracking and 3D vision for precise movement.
- **Obstacle Detection & Avoidance**: Detects and avoids obstacles in real-time.
- **Raspberry Pi 5 Powered**: Handles processing and control logic.
- **Delivery System**: Can transport small packages from one location to another.

## Hardware Components
- Raspberry Pi 5
- GPS Tracker Module
- 3D Camera (for vision and obstacle detection)
- Chassis (main robot body)
- Motors & Motor Driver
- Battery Pack

## Future Enhancements
- Implement AI-based path optimization
- Integrate real-time remote monitoring
- Improve battery efficiency
